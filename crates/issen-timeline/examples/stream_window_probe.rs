//! Prototype + measurement: bounded-memory streaming of the correlate timeline.
//!
//! The correlate stage today loads the ENTIRE timeline into a `Vec<StoredEvent>`
//! (measured 1564 B/event, 4.9 GB peak for 2.34M events). This probe streams the
//! timeline from DuckDB in time-ordered keyset batches and holds only a sliding
//! window sized to the MAX correlation rule window (24h: relocate/lateral_move),
//! evicting events that fall behind it. It reports the peak window occupancy —
//! the real RAM ceiling a windowed-streaming correlate would need — so the
//! "bounded by the densest window, not the whole timeline" claim is measured,
//! not assumed.
//!
//! Run: /usr/bin/time -l \
//!   target/release/examples/stream_window_probe /tmp/case001.duckdb
//!
//! NOTE: a faithful streaming correlate must keep the WINDOWLESS memory-leg
//! cross-product (proc_disk_match) resident separately — that set is the dump's
//! processes, bounded and small. This probe measures the relational-rule window.
