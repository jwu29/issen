//! `issen correlate <case-dir>` — discover evidence, ingest the disk leg into
//! one timeline, run the cross-artifact correlation rules, and render a
//! "Correlated Findings" report (capstone task #37, plan v5 §7).
//!
//! This is a thin Humble-Object shell: the discovery/sequencing decisions and
//! the report rendering are pulled into testable free functions
//! ([`discover_evidence`], [`render_correlated_findings`]); `run` only wires
//! ingest → `run_and_persist` → print.
//!
//! The memory leg (Tier C) is intentionally out of scope here — the runner it
//! calls leaves an additive seam for memory-rule firings, so when that leg is
//! wired its correlations flow into the same report section unchanged.
