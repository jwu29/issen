**One command turns disk + memory evidence into a correlated, ATT&CK-mapped attack narrative.**

Issen is the orchestration layer of the SecurityRonin forensic fleet — a multi-crate Rust workspace and the `issen` CLI. Hand it acquired evidence, and it auto-detects the container, triages the filesystem for the artifacts that matter, parses each one, and builds a single queryable timeline you can scan and report on.

---

```bash
# One command: ingest disk artifacts, parse memory dumps, correlate, and scan —
# in a single resumable pass. Auto-detects E01/EWF/VMDK/raw + memory dumps.
issen evidence.E01 memory.raw -o case.duckdb

# Read the result: the correlated attack narrative as text (or a shareable HTML report)
issen report case.duckdb --format text
```

One command takes a raw acquisition to a correlated attack narrative. No Python env, no dependency hell — one static binary.

**Resumable by default.** Ingest fingerprints each artifact by content, so re-running re-parses only what changed — a crash, an added source, or a repeated run picks up where it stopped instead of redoing the whole case. An unchanged warm re-ingest drops from **7.36 s to 0.20 s** (~37×): the second pass reads nothing it already has.

---

## How it works

Issen ingests evidence from five independent source types, then correlates across all of them:

<a href="https://securityronin.github.io/issen/architecture-diagram.html">
  <img src="assets/architecture.png"
       alt="Issen architecture diagram — 5 navigation primitives with PARSER, NAVIGATION, CONTAINER, [H] State-History, and KNOWLEDGE layers"
       width="100%"/>
</a>

*Click the diagram to open the [full interactive version](https://securityronin.github.io/issen/architecture-diagram.html).*

- **Ingests** UAC live response collections, Velociraptor query results, EVTX logs, memory dumps, git repositories, and OCI registries — simultaneously.
- **Correlates** evidence across all five source types using the Pivot engine: a network connection isn't a finding on its own; combined with a hidden PID, a loaded rootkit library, and a supply-chain hash match, it is.
- **Outputs** a structured Finding with severity, rule name, and the full evidence chain — ready for your report.

No Python env. No dependency hell. One static binary.

### The five source types

| ID | Source | Navigation primitive | What it captures |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[P]** | Persistent Storage | `name → inode → block` | Disk images (E01/raw), filesystems, file artifacts |
| **[M]** | Memory | `PID → EPROCESS → VA → PA` | RAM dumps, hiberfil.sys, live-at-time process state |
| **[L]** | Log | `timestamp → record → field` | EVTX, journal, tracev3, CloudTrail, Zeek/Suricata |
| **[Q]** | Live Query | `(endpoint, query, cursor) → rows` | Ephemeral state an attacker cannot retroactively destroy |
| **[C]** | Content-Addressed | `hash → blob → content graph` | Supply chain provenance, Merkle DAG traversal |

**[Q] Live Query** differs fundamentally from the other sources: the data is *produced* by a query rather than *retrieved* from storage. Once captured, the result set is attacker-durable — no subsequent disk wipe changes what `velociraptor collect` saw at query time. The query itself becomes part of the evidence chain.

**[C] Content-Addressed** gives every artifact a globally-unique, tamper-evident identity: its hash. Issen can pivot from a malicious binary hash across git commits, OCI image layers, and Sigstore transparency log entries to answer "which systems ran this exact blob, when, and where did it come from?"

---

## Components

Issen is the thin orchestration layer wiring a family of standalone forensic libraries — each a deep, self-contained expert in one artifact family, independently usable in your own tooling. The whole fleet, grouped by the five navigation primitives, the shared knowledge leaves, and the `[H]` state-history functor:

**Knowledge — zero-dep specs & shared vocabulary**

## Install

```bash
# Prebuilt binaries — Windows .exe/.msi and Apple-silicon .dmg — on the Releases page:
#   https://github.com/SecurityRonin/issen/releases

# …or build from source (uses the pinned toolchain in rust-toolchain.toml)
cargo install --git https://github.com/SecurityRonin/issen issen-cli

# Verify
issen --version
```

## The headline workflow

```bash
# The default pipeline — ingest disk artifacts, parse memory dumps, correlate
# cross-artifact rules, and scan cached threat-intel feeds. Pass any mix of disk
# images and memory dumps; re-run the same command to resume where it stopped.
issen DC01.E01 DESKTOP.E01 DC01-memory.raw -o case.duckdb

# Read the result: correlated findings as text, or a self-contained HTML report
issen report case.duckdb --format text
issen report case.duckdb -o report.html
```

Issen auto-detects each container via its `CollectionProvider` registry, triages the NTFS volume for the artifacts that matter, parses each one, walks memory dumps for process / network / injection state, and correlates everything into one super-timeline. `issen timeline`, `issen report`, and `issen info` all read the same DuckDB database.

### What it triages from a disk image

When the evidence is a Windows disk image, Issen walks the NTFS filesystem and extracts:

- **`$MFT`** — the Master File Table (file metadata + timestamps)
- **`$Extend\$UsnJrnl:$J`** — the USN change journal (file create/delete/rename history)
- **All `.evtx`** event logs under `Windows\System32\winevt\Logs` (Security, System, Application, Sysmon, and every other channel)
- **Registry hives** — `SYSTEM`, `SOFTWARE`, `SAM`, `SECURITY`, `DEFAULT`, plus per-user `NTUSER.DAT`
- **`SRUDB.dat`** — the System Resource Usage Monitor database

### Fastest evidence formats

Issen reads only the artifacts a triage needs, so it ingests fastest from containers that allow random access **without inflating the whole image**. For the quickest runs:

- ✅ **E01/EWF** — chunk-indexed, so reads stay selective at full compression. The recommended default for acquired evidence.
- ✅ **raw `.dd`**, or an image stored *uncompressed* inside a **zip** — zero decompression.
- ✅ **`.bz2` / `.tar.bz2`** — block-seekable; reads decode only the blocks they touch.
- ✅ **deflate-compressed zip** (e.g. an `.E01.zip` — the shape evidence often ships in) — made seekable by a pure-Rust `zran` DEFLATE index: bounded RAM, decodes only the blocks a triage touches (validated reading an **80 GB** image at **304 MB** peak RSS). Pays a one-pass index build.
- ⚠️ **`.tar.gz`, `.7z`** — no random-access unit, so Issen must decompress the *entire* image before it can read anything. Fine for transport (e.g. an `.E01.7z`), but extract it to a fast format first.

See [Selective Decompression for Triage](https://github.com/SecurityRonin/issen/blob/main/docs/selective-decompression-triage.md) for why.

---

## Trust but verify

Issen has been run end-to-end against a real **29 GB DEF CON E01** acquisition: it auto-detected the container, triaged the NTFS volume, and parsed **843 artifacts** into a **431,863-event** DuckDB timeline. Synthetic fixtures miss real-world quirks; validation against genuine acquired evidence is part of the development discipline.

---

## Fast on real evidence

Engineered to stay bounded at real-world scale — measured, not asserted:

- **Bounded RAM at any size.** Reads an **80 GB** macOS image straight from its deflate-compressed zip (the `zran` DEFLATE index) at **304 MB** peak RSS — RAM doesn't scale with image size.
- **Resumable by default.** Re-ingesting an unchanged case drops **7.36 s → 0.20 s** (~37×); only changed content re-parses.
- **Parallel and deterministic.** Evidence sources and their artifacts parse concurrently, and the timeline is byte-identical regardless of which finishes first.
- **Columnar bulk-load.** Events land through DuckDB's columnar appender, not row-at-a-time inserts — the ingest insert phase runs **~11× faster** (194 s → 17 s).

## Correlation Rules

Most tools find indicators. Issen finds **attack patterns** by joining evidence across sources automatically.

A Correlation Rule looks like this:

```yaml
id: correlation.miner.rootkit-concealment
severity: critical
description: Rootkit concealing cryptominer activity via LD_PRELOAD
within_seconds: 300
references:
  - https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/trends/linux-coinminers/
clauses:
  - source: artifact
    required_tag: rootkit_indicator
  - source: memory
    required_tag: miner_thread
  - source: memory
    required_tag: mining_pool
```

Rules are YAML files in `~/.config/issen/rules/`. Ship your own. Share with your team.

The bundled rule set ships with rules covering miners, rootkits, SSH tunnels, LD_PRELOAD persistence, hidden processes, and LOLRMM RATs. Custom rules compose with the built-ins — a single `issen <evidence>` pass evaluates all of them.

### Attack Flow STIX ingestion

The correlation engine also ingests CTID Attack Flow v3.0.0 corpus bundles (STIX 2.1 JSON). Each bundle is parsed into an `AttackFlowBundle` and converted to a `CorrelationRule` via BFS traversal of the `effect_refs` DAG. Every `attack-action` with a `technique_id` becomes a rule clause with `required_tag: "technique:<ID>"`. The bundled corpus is downloaded with `issen feed update`.

```bash
# Fetch and index the Attack Flow corpus
issen feed update

# The engine evaluates Attack Flow rules alongside your YAML rules in the default pass
issen collection.tar.gz
```

<details>
<summary>Why YAML rules and not hard-coded detections?</summary>

Hard-coded detections age badly. Threat actors change port numbers, rename binaries, and swap libraries. YAML rules are versionable, shareable, and reviewable in a pull request. The correlation engine is stable; the rules are data.

|  [HIGH] Lateral movement via service account

|    Evidence: Type 3 logon CORP\svc_backup from 10.20.5.44 (WIN-RUNBOOK)
|              File drop + service install within 120s of logon
|    MITRE   : T1021.002

  2 findings | 1 critical, 1 high | 4 artifact sources correlated
```

The correlation engine flagged AnyDesk installed under `C:\ProgramData\Temp\Support\` — not its standard `Program Files` path — with outbound connections to a Russian ASN outside AnyDesk's relay infrastructure. The timeline shows a service account logon from an internal host, followed by file drop, service install, and first C2 callback within a four-minute window: the attacker pivoted from `WIN-RUNBOOK` using `svc_backup` credentials to deploy the RAT on `WIN10-CORP`.
