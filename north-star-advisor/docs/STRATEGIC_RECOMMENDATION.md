## Part 1: Situation Summary

### 1.1 The Problem

Digital forensic practitioners spend approximately 80% of engagement time on manual report writing, evidence reformatting, and attorney back-and-forth --- not on forensic analysis itself. The current workflow for a standard incident response triage case takes approximately 16 hours from evidence ingestion to a deliverable that an attorney can actually use in court. Of those 16 hours, only 3--4 are spent on actual forensic analysis. The rest is translation work: copying findings into Word documents, reformatting timelines, adding proper exhibit numbering, writing narrative sections that explain technical findings in legal terms, and iterating with counsel on clarity.

No existing forensic tool treats the report as the product. Every tool on the market treats the report as an afterthought --- an export button buried three menus deep that produces CSV dumps or bare-bones PDFs that require hours of manual post-processing.

### 1.2 The Opportunity

Issen is positioned to occupy a genuinely unoccupied market position: the intersection of **Full Workflow** and **Practitioner-Friendly** in the DFIR tooling landscape. This position is unoccupied because:

- **Magnet AXIOM** is Full Workflow but Enterprise-Optimized (and increasingly price-hostile under PE ownership).
- **Autopsy/TSK** is Practitioner-Friendly but analysis-only (no meaningful report pipeline).
- **X-Ways** is Expert-Optimized with the fastest parsing but zero reporting capability.
- **EnCase** and **FTK** are Enterprise-Legacy with rigid templates and declining relevance.

The specific gap: **automated forensic-to-attorney report generation**. No competitor produces attorney-ready output. Every competitor requires the practitioner to manually bridge the gap between forensic findings and legal deliverables.

### 1.3 Market Context

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **TAM** | ~$9B global digital forensics; ~$1.5B triage/reporting segment |
| **Growth** | ~12% CAGR |
| **PE consolidation** | Thoma Bravo acquired Magnet for $1.8B; OpenText owns EnCase. Pricing pressure is driving practitioner frustration. |
| **AI timing** | AI-assisted triage is entering mainstream (Magnet.AI, BelkaGPT), but no one has applied AI to the reporting bottleneck. 12--18 month first-mover window. |
| **Collection standardization** | KAPE and Velociraptor are standardizing collection formats. Analysis-to-report is the remaining unsolved gap. |
| **Court pressure** | Daubert challenges have increased 35%. Attorney-ready output with proper methodology documentation is becoming table stakes. |

### 1.4 Founder Position

- **Solo founder, bootstrapped.** Consulting revenue funds development.
- **Practitioner founder.** Direct experience with the pain. Built the consulting workflow being automated.
- **Existing Rust crates:** `usnjrnl-forensic` v0.6, `tl` v0.1, `ewf` v0.1, `shrinkpath` v0.1 --- not starting from zero.
- **Architecture selected:** Hexagonal (Crux-inspired), Rust, DuckDB + SQLite, three-tier plugins, local-first AI, open-core model.

### 1.5 North Star Metric

**Time-to-Attorney-Ready Report (TARR):** Elapsed time from evidence ingestion to completed attorney-ready deliverable.

- **Baseline:** ~16 hours (manual workflow)
- **Target:** < 4 hours (50%+ reduction)
- **Current (with existing crates):** ~8 hours

Every strategic decision in this document is evaluated against its impact on TARR. If a path does not measurably improve TARR, it is the wrong path.

## Part 2: Strategic Paths

### Path A: Parser Foundation First

**Thesis:** Build a comprehensive open-source parser library first (12+ artifact types), maximize community adoption and GitHub stars, then layer proprietary report engine on top of an established ecosystem.

**Execution Sequence:**

| Quarter | Focus | Deliverables |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Q2 2026 | Core parsers | MFT parser, EventLog parser, Registry parser (4 total with USN Journal) |
| Q3 2026 | Expand coverage | Prefetch, LNK, ShellBags, ShimCache, Amcache (9 total) |
| Q4 2026 | Deep artifacts | Browser history, SRUM, Scheduled Tasks (12 total) |
| Q1 2027 | Report engine v0.1 | Basic report generation against full parser library |

**Strengths:**

- Maximizes open-source community gravity. GitHub stars attract contributors and users organically.
- Broad artifact coverage makes the platform useful for diverse case types from day one (once reports ship).
- Positions parsers as the "industry standard" Rust forensic library, creating a gravitational pull toward the proprietary integration layer.
- Low risk of wasted parser work --- parsers are useful regardless of reporting strategy.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Zero TARR improvement for 9+ months.** Parsers without report generation produce faster analysis but the manual report-writing bottleneck remains unchanged.
- **No revenue path until Q1 2027.** Open-source parsers are the free tier; the paid product (reports) doesn't exist yet.
- **Competitor window exposure.** 9 months is long enough for Magnet to add AI-assisted reporting or for Belkasoft to improve BelkaGPT's output quality.
- **Community without conversion funnel.** Users adopt parsers, build workflows around raw output, and never need the proprietary layer.
- **Solo founder sustainability.** 9 months of open-source work with no revenue pressure on consulting income.

**TARR Impact:** Indirect. Faster parsing reduces the first 20% of the workflow (analysis) but does nothing for the 80% (report writing). Estimated TARR improvement: ~14 hours (minor reduction from faster parsing alone).

**Risk Assessment:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Competitors ship reporting first | Medium | Critical | Accelerate report timeline if competitor signals emerge |
| Community doesn't materialize | Medium | High | Parsers still useful for proprietary product |
| Consulting revenue insufficient for 9-month runway | Low | Critical | Reduce parser scope, bring report engine forward |

---

### Path B: Report Engine First

**Thesis:** Build a minimal but sufficient parser set (USN Journal + MFT + EventLog) with a full attorney-ready report pipeline from day one. Demonstrate the core differentiator immediately. Open-source parsers as they stabilize; community contributes additional parsers into an existing integration framework.

**Execution Sequence:**

| Quarter | Focus | Deliverables |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Q2 2026 | Report pipeline + MFT parser | MFT parser, report template engine, HTML output, Word/PDF generation, exhibit numbering |
| Q3 2026 | EventLog parser + report polish | EventLog parser, narrative generation (local LLM), attorney feedback integration, Daubert methodology sections |
| Q4 2026 | Correlation + intelligence | Cross-artifact correlation, YARA-X/Sigma integration, AI-assisted narrative refinement |
| Q1 2027 | Community + expansion | Open-source parser SDK, community parser contributions, additional artifact types driven by user demand |

**Strengths:**

- **Immediate TARR impact.** The report engine directly attacks the 80% bottleneck from sprint one.
- **Revenue from day one.** The proprietary report engine is the monetizable product. Paying users validate product-market fit before scaling.
- **Demonstrates the differentiator.** No competitor has attorney-ready output. Showing this capability, even with only 3 artifact types, is more compelling than showing 12 parsers with manual report writing.
- **3 parsers cover 60--70% of typical IR triage.** USN Journal (file activity), MFT (file system metadata), and EventLog (system/security events) handle the majority of standard incident response cases.
- **Community parser contributions are easier to attract** when the integration framework already exists. Contributors can see exactly where their parser output goes and how it appears in the final report.
- **First-mover advantage on AI reporting.** 12--18 month window before competitors add this capability.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Limited artifact coverage in v0.1.** Cases requiring Registry, Prefetch, or browser artifacts will feel incomplete. Practitioners may perceive Issen as "not ready" for their workflow.
- **Report quality depends on AI maturity.** Local LLM narrative generation may not meet attorney expectations without significant prompt engineering and validation.
- **Smaller open-source footprint.** Fewer parsers means less GitHub gravity in the early months.
- **Risk of over-engineering reports before understanding all artifact types.** Report templates designed for 3 artifacts may need restructuring when artifact count grows.

**TARR Impact:** Direct. Attacks the 80% bottleneck. Estimated TARR with 3 parsers and full report pipeline: < 4 hours for cases within artifact coverage. Cases outside coverage: hybrid (Issen for supported artifacts + manual for gaps), estimated ~6--8 hours.

**Risk Assessment:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Limited coverage perceived as "incomplete" | Medium | Medium | Clear messaging: "Covers 60-70% of IR triage cases"; roadmap for expansion |
| AI narrative quality insufficient | Medium | High | Human-in-the-loop review; template-based fallback; iterative prompt engineering |
| Report template needs restructuring for new artifacts | Low | Medium | Modular template architecture; artifact-agnostic report sections |

---

### Path C: Balanced Incremental

**Thesis:** Alternate development sprints between parser work and report features. Aim for decent artifact coverage and decent report quality simultaneously, avoiding the risk of going all-in on either dimension.

**Execution Sequence:**

| Quarter | Focus | Deliverables |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Q2 2026 | 2 parsers + basic report | MFT parser, EventLog parser, basic HTML report (no narrative generation) |
| Q3 2026 | 2 parsers + report improvement | Registry parser, Prefetch parser, Word/PDF output, improved formatting |
| Q4 2026 | 2 parsers + AI narrative | Browser history, ShellBags, local LLM narrative generation, exhibit numbering |
| Q1 2027 | Polish + release | 8 total parsers, complete report pipeline, public release |

**Strengths:**

- **Balanced risk.** Neither parser coverage nor report quality is neglected. If one dimension proves harder than expected, the other provides value.
- **Steady artifact growth.** 2 parsers per quarter provides a visible, predictable cadence of capability expansion.
- **Gradual report complexity.** Report features build incrementally, reducing risk of over-engineering early.

**Weaknesses:**

- **Neither dimension reaches compelling threshold quickly.** At any given point, Issen has fewer parsers than Path A and worse reports than Path B. The product is perpetually "almost there."
- **No clear differentiator early.** With basic reports and moderate artifact coverage, what is the elevator pitch? "We do a bit of everything, but nothing exceptionally well yet" does not attract early adopters.
- **Context-switching overhead.** Alternating between parser development (low-level binary parsing, correctness testing) and report development (template engines, AI integration, formatting) creates cognitive overhead for a solo founder.
- **Delayed TARR improvement.** Basic HTML reports without narrative generation don't dramatically improve TARR. The full pipeline isn't complete until Q1 2027.
- **Competitive window risk.** Same 12-month exposure as Path A, but without either the community gravity (Path A) or the differentiator demonstration (Path B).

**TARR Impact:** Gradual. Each quarter brings incremental improvement but the full TARR reduction is not achieved until Q1 2027. Estimated trajectory: Q2: ~12hr, Q3: ~10hr, Q4: ~7hr, Q1 2027: ~5hr. Note: may never reach < 4hr target because report quality plateaus at "decent" rather than "attorney-ready."

**Risk Assessment:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Neither dimension reaches compelling threshold | High | High | Commit to one dimension if traction signals are weak by Q3 |
| Context-switching reduces velocity | Medium | Medium | Batch work in 2-week sprints to reduce switching |
| Competitors ship focused solution while we spread thin | Medium | Critical | Monitor competitor signals; pivot to Path B if threats emerge |

---

## Part 3: Path Comparison

### 3.1 Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | Path A: Parser Foundation | Path B: Report Engine | Path C: Balanced |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **TARR at 6 months** | ~14 hours (marginal) | < 4 hours (within coverage) | ~10 hours |
| **TARR at 12 months** | ~6 hours (report v0.1) | < 4 hours (expanded coverage) | ~5 hours |
| **Artifact coverage at 6 months** | 9 types | 3 types | 4 types |
| **Artifact coverage at 12 months** | 12+ types | 6--8 types (with community) | 8 types |
| **Revenue timeline** | Q1 2027 (9+ months) | Q3 2026 (3--4 months) | Q4 2026 (6--7 months) |
| **First-mover on reporting** | No (delayed) | Yes (immediate) | Partial (gradual) |
| **Community gravity** | Highest | Medium (grows with SDK) | Low |
| **Competitor exposure** | 9 months | 3 months | 9 months |
| **Solo founder sustainability** | Strained (long runway to revenue) | Strong (early validation) | Moderate |
| **Differentiator clarity** | "Best Rust parsers" | "Attorney-ready reports" | "Does everything OK" |
| **Alignment with North Star** | Indirect | Direct | Gradual |

### 3.2 Decision Matrix

Weighted scoring against strategic priorities. Scale: 1 (poor) -- 5 (excellent).

| Criterion | Weight | Path A | Path B | Path C |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **TARR impact speed** | 30% | 1 | 5 | 2 |
| **Competitive differentiation** | 25% | 3 | 5 | 2 |
| **Revenue timeline** | 15% | 1 | 5 | 3 |
| **Community ecosystem** | 10% | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| **Solo founder feasibility** | 10% | 2 | 4 | 3 |
| **Risk profile** | 10% | 2 | 3 | 2 |
| **Weighted Score** | 100% | **2.15** | **4.50** | **2.30** |

### 3.3 Axiom Alignment Check

| Axiom | Path A | Path B | Path C |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Correctness > Speed** | Aligned (parser focus ensures correctness) | Aligned (fewer parsers, more testing per parser) | Neutral (spread thin may compromise both) |
| **Report is the Product** | Violated (report deferred 9+ months) | Strongly aligned (report from day one) | Partially aligned (basic reports, not attorney-ready early) |
| **Practitioner First** | Aligned (tools practitioners use) | Strongly aligned (solves practitioner pain immediately) | Neutral |
| **Open Parsers, Proprietary Integration** | Aligned (parsers first) | Aligned (proprietary report is the product) | Aligned |
| **Evidence Tells a Story** | Misaligned (no narrative output) | Strongly aligned (narrative generation is core) | Partially aligned |

Path B is the only path that aligns with all five axioms. Path A directly violates "Report is the Product." Path C partially satisfies most axioms without strongly aligning with any.

---

## Part 4: The Recommendation

### 4.1 Recommended Path: B --- Report Engine First

**Path B is the recommended strategic path for Issen.** Build the minimum viable parser set (USN Journal + MFT + EventLog) paired with a full attorney-ready report pipeline, and ship the core differentiator from day one.

### 4.2 Reasoning

**1. TARR is the North Star, and the report IS the bottleneck.**

The North Star metric --- Time-to-Attorney-Ready Report --- is defined by the deliverable. Building parsers without a report engine produces zero improvement to the metric that matters. Path B is the only path that directly attacks TARR from sprint one. The 80/20 split is real and validated through consulting experience: 80% of engagement time is report writing, 20% is analysis. A 50% improvement in parser speed (Path A) reduces TARR by approximately 2 hours. A report engine (Path B) reduces TARR by 8--12 hours.

**2. No competitor has attorney-ready output. This is the only genuine gap in the market.**

Magnet AXIOM has AI triage. Autopsy has free analysis. X-Ways has the fastest parsing. Every competitor has some version of "analysis." Zero competitors produce a deliverable that an attorney can use without hours of manual reformatting. Path B demonstrates this gap from day one. Path A demonstrates that Issen can parse files --- which is what every other tool already does.

**3. Three parsers cover 60--70% of typical IR triage cases.**

USN Journal, MFT, and EventLog are not arbitrary choices. They are the three artifact types that appear in virtually every Windows incident response engagement:

- **USN Journal**: File creation, deletion, rename activity. Establishes what happened on the filesystem.
- **MFT**: File metadata, timestamps, directory structure. Corroborates USN findings and provides additional context.
- **EventLog**: Authentication events, service installations, PowerShell execution. Establishes who did what and when.

A practitioner can construct a complete incident narrative from these three sources for the majority of standard triage cases. Additional artifacts (Registry, Prefetch, browser) improve depth but are not required for the initial deliverable.

**4. Community parser contributions are easier to attract once the framework exists.**

Open-source contributors are more motivated to add a parser when they can see exactly how their parser output flows through the pipeline and appears in the final report. "Write a parser, see it in the attorney-ready report" is a more compelling contribution pitch than "Write a parser, see it in a library."

**5. Revenue comes from the report engine (proprietary), not parsers (open-source).**

Under the open-core model, parsers are Apache 2.0 and free. The report engine, correlation engine, and AI narrative generation are proprietary. Path B builds the monetizable product first. Path A builds the free tier first. For a bootstrapped solo founder funding development through consulting revenue, validating the revenue path early is not optional --- it is a survival requirement.

**6. The 12--18 month first-mover window is real and time-limited.**

Magnet has the resources, data, and user base to add AI-assisted reporting. They have not done so yet because PE ownership prioritizes margin extraction over innovation, and their architecture was not designed for it. But this window will close. If Issen ships attorney-ready reports in Q2--Q3 2026, it has 6--12 months of market exclusivity for the core differentiator. If Issen spends Q2--Q4 2026 building parsers (Path A), the window may close before the differentiator ships.

### 4.3 Focus Areas (Traced to TARR)

Every focus area must trace directly to TARR reduction. Here is the mapping:

| Focus Area | TARR Stage Impacted | Estimated TARR Reduction |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Report template engine** | Report writing (manual -> automated) | -6 to -8 hours |
| **Dual-format output (HTML + Word/PDF)** | Formatting and delivery | -1 to -2 hours |
| **Exhibit numbering and citations** | Legal formatting | -0.5 to -1 hour |
| **AI-assisted narrative generation** | Finding-to-prose translation | -2 to -3 hours |
| **MFT parser** | Analysis (new artifact) | -0.5 hours |
| **EventLog parser** | Analysis (new artifact) | -0.5 hours |
| **Cross-artifact correlation** | Manual cross-referencing | -1 to -2 hours |
| **Daubert methodology sections** | Methodology documentation | -0.5 to -1 hour |

**Total estimated TARR reduction: 12--18 hours** (from ~16hr baseline to < 4hr target, with some overlap between areas).

### 4.4 The Avoid List

These items are explicitly out of scope for the recommended path. They align with the product non-goals and are deferred or rejected:

| Avoid Item | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| **Mobile forensics** | Different evidence domain, different parsers, different legal frameworks. Cellebrite and MSAB own this market. |
| **Memory forensics** | Specialized discipline. Volatility and Rekall are excellent. Separate skill set entirely. |
| **Malware analysis / sandboxing** | Separate discipline with dedicated tools (IDA, Ghidra, Cuckoo). |
| **Cloud forensics** | Platform-specific, rapidly evolving APIs. Phase 3+ consideration at earliest. |
| **Real-time collection** | Collection is solved (KAPE, Velociraptor). Issen ingests their output. |
| **eDiscovery workflows** | Different problem, different users, different regulatory requirements. Issen exports to Relativity/Nuix. |
| **SIEM / detection engineering** | Post-incident analysis, not real-time monitoring. Different domain entirely. |
| **Enterprise-first features** | SSO, RBAC, audit logs are Phase 3. Optimize for Sarah Chen (solo practitioner) first. |
| **GUI-first architecture** | CLI and TUI first. Desktop GUI (Tauri) is Phase 2. |
| **Subscription-only pricing** | Solo practitioners need perpetual or usage-based options. Subscription-only alienates the primary persona. |
| **Feature-count marketing** | "12 artifact types" is meaningless if the report is manual. Market the outcome (TARR < 4hr), not the feature count. |
| **Parser coverage breadth over depth** | 3 correct parsers with full report integration beats 12 parsers with CSV export. |

### 4.5 Next Steps with Measurable Outcomes

| Step | Timeline | Outcome | Measurement |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **1. MFT parser implementation** | Weeks 1--3 | MFT parser producing correct, validated output against Eric Zimmerman's MFTECmd reference | 100% timestamp accuracy on NIST test images |
| **2. Report template engine** | Weeks 2--5 | Template engine rendering structured forensic data into formatted HTML with exhibit numbering | Report renders in < 2 seconds for 10,000 timeline events |
| **3. Word/PDF generation** | Weeks 4--6 | Dual-format output: interactive HTML + polished Word document from same data source | Attorney reviews Word output and confirms "usable without reformatting" (user testing) |
| **4. EventLog parser** | Weeks 5--8 | EVTX parser producing correct, validated output for Security, System, and PowerShell/Operational logs | 100% accuracy on EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES reference dataset |
| **5. Timeline merge with report integration** | Weeks 7--9 | Unified timeline from USN + MFT + EVTX flowing into report template automatically | Single-command pipeline: evidence in, report out |
| **6. AI narrative generation v0.1** | Weeks 8--11 | Local LLM (Ollama) generating finding narratives from structured timeline data | Narratives pass attorney readability review; factual accuracy > 95% |
| **7. Daubert methodology sections** | Weeks 10--12 | Automated methodology documentation meeting Daubert/Frye requirements | Methodology sections validated by litigation support analyst |
| **8. Alpha release to consulting clients** | Week 12 | End-to-end pipeline used on real consulting engagement | TARR < 4 hours on a standard IR triage case |

### 4.6 Strategic Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Criterion | Kill Criterion |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **M1: First attorney-ready report** | End of Q2 2026 | One complete report from evidence-to-deliverable pipeline, used on a real engagement | Cannot produce a report that an attorney accepts without manual rework |
| **M2: TARR < 4 hours validated** | End of Q3 2026 | 3 real engagements completed with TARR < 4 hours, measured end-to-end | Average TARR > 6 hours across 3 engagements |
| **M3: First paying user (non-consulting)** | End of Q4 2026 | Revenue from a practitioner who is not the founder's consulting client | Zero external revenue by end of Q4 2026 |
| **M4: Community parser contribution** | End of Q1 2027 | At least 1 community-contributed parser merged and integrated into the report pipeline | Zero community contributions after 6 months of open-source availability |

---

## Part 5: Confidence Assessment

### 5.1 Confidence Matrix

| Dimension | Level | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Problem Understanding** | **High** | Practitioner founder with direct consulting experience. The pain is lived, not theoretical. Validated through hundreds of engagements where 80% of time is report writing. The forensic-to-legal translation gap is not a hypothesis --- it is a daily reality. |
| **Solution Fit** | **High** | Attorney-ready report generation is validated as genuine market whitespace. No competitor occupies this position. The "Full Workflow + Practitioner-Friendly" quadrant is empty. Consulting clients have confirmed they would pay for this capability. |
| **Execution Feasibility** | **Medium** | Solo founder is both the strength (no coordination overhead, practitioner expertise) and the constraint (limited bandwidth, no redundancy). Rust expertise maximizes velocity, and existing crates provide a head start. However, the scope is large: 3 parsers + report engine + AI narrative + dual-format output in 12 weeks is aggressive. The architecture (hexagonal, port/adapter) is well-suited but unproven at this scale for this domain. |
| **Market Timing** | **High** | Three converging windows: (1) Post-PE pricing frustration driving AXIOM practitioners to seek alternatives, (2) AI reporting feasibility reaching the threshold where local LLMs can generate useful narrative, (3) KAPE/Velociraptor standardization creating a stable ingestion layer that Issen can build on. All three windows are open now and estimated to narrow within 12--18 months. |
| **Team Capability** | **Medium** | Solo founder with deep Rust expertise and forensic domain knowledge --- an unusual and valuable combination. However, the solo founder ceiling is real: no UI/UX specialist, no sales/marketing capacity, no redundancy for illness or burnout. Consulting income provides runway but also competes for time. Phase 2+ will require at least one additional contributor (likely a community member or part-time hire). |

### 5.2 What Could Prove Us Wrong

These are the specific scenarios that would invalidate the recommendation. Each includes a trigger for strategic review.

| Falsification Scenario | Probability | Detection Signal | Response |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| **Magnet ships native attorney-ready reports within 12 months** | Low-Medium | Magnet product announcements, user reviews mentioning report quality improvements, competitive intelligence | Accelerate differentiation on open-source parsers and Rust performance. Compete on price and practitioner-friendliness rather than feature exclusivity. |
| **Practitioners don't pay for reports** | Low | Alpha users complete the pipeline but revert to manual workflows. Conversion from free tier to paid report features < 5% after 3 months. | Investigate whether the free HTML export is "good enough." Consider alternative monetization (training, templates, consulting integration). |
| **Local LLM narrative quality is insufficient** | Medium | Attorney feedback consistently rejects AI-generated narratives. > 50% of narrative sections require manual rewriting. | Fall back to structured template-based reports (fill-in-the-blank) without AI narrative. Still faster than manual, just less polished. AI narrative becomes Phase 2 feature when models improve. |
| **3-parser coverage is too narrow** | Medium | > 40% of real engagements require artifacts outside USN/MFT/EVTX. Users consistently report "I can't use this for my cases." | Accelerate Registry and Prefetch parsers. Re-evaluate whether Path C (balanced) would have been more appropriate. |
| **Solo founder burnout / bandwidth collapse** | Medium | Development velocity drops below 1 meaningful feature per 2 weeks for 4+ consecutive weeks. Consulting revenue commitments consume > 70% of working time. | Reduce scope to absolute minimum viable report (HTML only, no AI narrative). Seek community contributor for parser development. Consider part-time contractor for report template work. |

### 5.3 Review Triggers

The strategic recommendation should be formally reviewed (not just casually reconsidered) when any of the following thresholds are crossed:

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **TARR not improving** | TARR > 8 hours after 8 weeks of development | Stop and diagnose. Is the bottleneck in parsing, report generation, or AI narrative? Redirect resources to the bottleneck stage. |
| **Competitor signal** | Any major competitor announces attorney-ready report capability | Emergency strategy session. Evaluate whether to accelerate, differentiate, or pivot. |
| **Zero external interest** | Fewer than 10 practitioners express interest (GitHub stars, newsletter signups, conference conversations) after public announcement | Re-evaluate messaging. Is the problem real but the positioning wrong? Or is the market smaller than estimated? |
| **AI narrative failure** | Local LLM narrative quality does not reach "attorney-acceptable" after 4 weeks of prompt engineering | Descope AI narrative to Phase 2. Ship structured template-based reports. Adjust TARR target to < 6 hours (still a 62% improvement). |
| **Revenue validation failure** | Zero paying users after 6 months of availability | Fundamental business model review. Is the open-core split correct? Should parsers be paid? Should the product be a service instead of software? |
| **Consulting revenue pressure** | Consulting commitments exceed 30 hours/week for 3+ consecutive weeks | Reduce consulting load or accept slower development timeline. Recalculate milestones. |

### 5.4 Honest Assessment Summary

This recommendation is made with **high conviction on the "what" and medium conviction on the "when."**

- **High conviction**: The report engine is the right thing to build first. The market gap is real, the pain is validated, and no competitor is addressing it. Path B is strategically correct.
- **Medium conviction**: The 12-week timeline to alpha is aggressive for a solo founder balancing consulting revenue. The AI narrative component adds technical risk that could slip the timeline by 4--6 weeks. The "< 4 hours" TARR target may be achievable for cases within the 3-parser coverage but not for cases requiring broader artifact support.
- **Key uncertainty**: Whether local LLM quality is sufficient for attorney-acceptable narrative generation today, or whether this is a 6--12 month away capability. The fallback (structured templates without AI narrative) still delivers significant TARR improvement, just not the full vision.

The recommendation stands: **Build the report engine first.** Even if AI narrative generation is descoped to Phase 2, the structured report pipeline alone (template engine + dual-format output + exhibit numbering + methodology sections) reduces TARR from ~16 hours to an estimated ~6 hours. Adding AI narrative is the difference between "good" (< 6 hours) and "transformative" (< 4 hours), but the core value proposition holds either way.

## Appendix A: Axiom Application

For each strategic decision, this is how the five axioms were applied:

| Decision | Axiom Applied | How It Influenced |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Path B over Path A | "Report is the Product" | The report engine is the product. Building parsers first builds the free tier first. |
| 3 parsers, not 12 | "Evidence Tells a Story" | 3 artifacts that together tell the complete story of an incident are more valuable than 12 artifacts with no narrative output. |
| Attorney-ready output | "Practitioner First" | Practitioners spend 80% of time on report writing. Reducing this directly serves their workflow. |
| Open parsers, proprietary reports | "Open Parsers, Proprietary Integration" | Exact application of the axiom. Parsers are the commodity; integration is the value. |
| Correctness testing against reference tools | "Correctness > Speed" | Every parser validated against established reference implementations before shipping. |
